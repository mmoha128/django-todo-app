# django-todo-app

📜 About This Project
I started working on this simple Django To-Do App with a personal goal in mind: to brush up on my knowledge of Python and Django.

Over time, I've realized that it's easy to forget the core concepts when you don't actively apply them, and that's exactly what led me to create this project. I wanted to rebuild something basic yet practical—a to-do app—so I could revisit the concepts of web development using Django and Python. This would allow me to refresh and solidify my understanding while also working on something that felt real and useful.

🎯 The Motivation
As someone who's worked with Python before, I realized that to be truly comfortable with Django (and the backend development process), I needed to get my hands dirty again. I'd previously learned the basics but never really got around to diving deep into the full project workflow. Building a small web app like this allowed me to explore:

How Django handles data models
Setting up user authentication
Managing forms and views
Connecting the app to a simple SQLite database
Deploying a Django project to a cloud platform (Render)
The main goal was to solidify the learning through application rather than just reading or watching tutorials. And what better way to do that than by building something simple, useful, and motivating?

🚀 Key Features
Task Management: Add, delete, and update to-do items.
User Authentication: Secure logins for personalized to-do lists.
Database: All tasks are stored in an SQLite database to persist data.
Deployment: The app is deployed online, making it accessible anywhere.
⚙️ How It Works
Backend: Built using Python with Django as the web framework.
Frontend: Basic templates with HTML and CSS to keep it minimal and functional.
Database: SQLite to store the tasks locally.
Hosting: Deployed on Render, where you can access the live app using a custom subdomain.
🌱 What I Learned
While working on this project, I:

Reinforced my understanding of Django models, views, and templates.
Got hands-on experience with user authentication in Django.
Learned the importance of working with environments, managing requirements.txt, and creating a Procfile for deployment.
Gained insight into deploying a Django app on a cloud platform (Render).
It wasn't just about coding, though—it was about gaining confidence in Django and understanding how everything ties together in a web app.

📝 Final Thoughts
This project is a reflection of my journey to sharpen my skills, and I hope it can serve as a small stepping stone toward more complex Django applications in the future. It's proof that practice makes progress, and even small projects can lead to big improvements!
